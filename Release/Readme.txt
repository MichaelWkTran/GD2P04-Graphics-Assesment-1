All the features implemented are:
 - Enable scissor test to cut out the top and bottom part of the viewport.
 - Enable stencil test and produce a stencil outline around a rotating 3D object.
 - Using TinyObj Loader load 3D models.
 - Load Heightmap and draw terrains, texture them, and calculate proper normal information. 
 - Use Perlin Noise Algorithm generate patterns, generate a height map for a terrain, as well as be as an image on disk.
 - Apply fog effect on objects in the scene.
 - Generate a 3D texture and apply to an Object.


Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move the camera.
Hold the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON and DRAG YOUR MOUSE to rotate the camera.
Press Z on the keyboard to enable the stencil test. 
Press X on the keyboard to enable the scissor test.
Press C to save the generated perlin noise landscape into a raw image file. 

There are 3 terrains, The furthest left terrain is the terrain generated by perlin noise. The middle terrain is a terrain loaded from a saved perlin noise terrain. The furthest right terrain is a terrain loaded from a raw file and has 4 different textures of sand, grass, stone, and snow.
